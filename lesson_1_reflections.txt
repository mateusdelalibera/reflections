How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I could see only the lines that were removed and added. With fewer lines, I could check them until I found the wrong one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could compare the different versions and see how the file evolved through time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Having versions saved automatically can be bad because the program may save the file with something unfinished. Looking at it in a later moment would probably confuse the reader, that would have to understand what is missing.
Manually choosing when to save gives the programmer flexibility.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is used to control the versions of programs, that usually contain multiple files. In Google Docs files, it is unusual to have files interconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use git log to see the commit history with IDs and comments, and use git diff between two IDs to see their differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It makes me more confident because I know I can go back to a working commit.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to learn how to program better.
