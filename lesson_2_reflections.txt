What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a folder .git. I need to do it so I can use all git functionality.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains only the files in the working directory that someone wants to add to the repository. There may be files in the working directory that are not in the repository.
